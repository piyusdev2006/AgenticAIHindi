        "\n",
        "This assignment explores how large language models (LLMs) can perform complex tasks that previously required coding. Instead of manually writing code, we will interact with Google's Gemini (Click on the Gemini icon on the top right corner) in Google Colab to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and analyze stock price data.\n",
        "- Engineer relevant features for prediction.\n",
        "- Build and evaluate models such as regression and random forest.\n",
        "- Discuss potential trading strategies based on predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: While this notebook contains example code, students are encouraged to use LLMs to generate code snippets and explanations, managing interactions within the LLM's context window.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task Breakdown\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Data Exploration\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the model retains context while summarizing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Feature Engineering\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Generate meaningful features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and volatility measures.\n",
        "- **Managing Context**: If the LLM forgets prior outputs, remind it by reintroducing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Model Building\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Train a model (regression for price prediction, random forest for trend classification).\n",
        "- **Split Ratio Consideration**: Explain the importance of train-test split (e.g., 70/30) and verify the LLM respects it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Prediction\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices for 2023-2024.\n",
        "- **Analyze Performance**: Interpret accuracy, R² scores, and classification reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Strategy Discussion\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Based on model performance, discuss possible trading strategies.\n",
        "- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluate whether the model is truly useful for financial decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the assignment, keep in mind that LLMs have a limited context window. If necessary, break down tasks into smaller chunks and reintroduce critical information.\n",

        "- **Modeling with LLMs**: LLMs can write and refine code, but human judgment is necessary to validate results.\n",

            "The Random Forest classification model showed a moderate performance on the initial test data (accuracy ~52.8%), slightly better than random guessing. The classification report indicated similar performance for both classes (increase/decrease).\n",
            "However, when evaluated on the new data from 2023-2024, the model's performance significantly dropped (accuracy ~44.8%). The confusion matrix and classification report for the new data show a notable decrease in the model's ability to correctly predict price increases (low recall and F1-score for class 1), while it was somewhat better at identifying price decreases (higher recall for class 0, but lower precision).\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Potential Trading Strategies (with caution) ---\n",
            "Given the poor performance on recent data, relying solely on this model for trading is highly risky. However, if one were to consider strategies based on its limited insights:\n",
            "\n",
            "Conservative Strategy: Avoid trading when the model predicts a price increase (class 1) on the new data, as its ability to correctly identify these instances is very low. Perhaps consider shorting or staying out of the market when the model predicts a decrease (class 0), although the precision for this class is not high.\n",
            "\n",
            "Aggressive Strategy: This is not recommended given the model's performance on recent data. Any aggressive strategy based on this model would likely lead to significant losses.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Limitations and Risks ---\n",
            "The significant drop in performance on the 2023-2024 data highlights a major limitation: the model trained on older data does not generalize well to newer market conditions. This could be due to changing market dynamics, economic factors, or other external events not captured by the engineered features.\n",
            "The risks of using this model for real-world trading are high, including frequent incorrect predictions, especially for price increases, leading to potential financial losses. Past performance on older data is not indicative of future results, especially with a model that doesn't generalize well.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Next Steps for Improvement ---\n",
            "1.  **Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated features, including technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and volatility measures beyond just daily range and return. Consider incorporating economic indicators or sentiment analysis if accessible.\n",
            "2.  **Data Period:** Retrain the model on a more recent and potentially longer time frame that includes the data from 2023-2024 to capture current market trends.\n",
            "3.  **Model Selection and Tuning:** Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, SVM, Neural Networks) and tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model.\n",
            "4.  **Time Series Cross-Validation:** Use time series specific cross-validation techniques to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance on future data.\n",
            "5.  **Incorporate External Factors:** If possible, include features related to news sentiment, social media trends, or relevant economic announcements that could influence stock prices.\n"

This highlights the dynamic nature of financial markets and the need for models to adapt to changing trends.\n",

Future work should focus on retraining the model with more recent data, exploring more sophisticated features (including external factors), and potentially using more advanced modeling techniques suited for time series data to improve generalization and predictive power.\n"
